# 💻 Hey, Hacker

> “Let's embbed the knowledge into your sou(l)rce”  
> — _Kris3c Manifesto_

You're now inside the **0x4B1T hacker space**, a fusion of guides, write-ups, experiments, and wild ideas. This isn’t just another doc site — it’s a tactical grid for the curious minds.

We operate across **four core modules**. Let’s plug you in:

---

### 1. [Hackries](/hackries/find-your-way)

Think of this as your structured hacker's guidebook.  
Whether you're diving into binary exploitation or exploring web internals — this is where we break things down, frame-by-frame.

> _Exploit. Learn. Repeat._

---

### 2. [Articles](/articles/find-your-way)

When we’re not breaking stuff, we’re thinking.  
Deep dives into vulnerabilities, tech culture, threat models, philosophy of open source, or rants about broken APIs.

> _Long-form curiosity._

---

### 3. [Writeups](/writeups/find-your-way)

Real-world CTFs. Red team labs.  
Sometimes just an itch to pop a shell and document it for the culture.  
Expect payloads, shellcode, recon notes, and battle scars.

> _Proof of knowledge._

---

### 4. [Projects](/projects/find-your-way)

Scripts, tools, honeypots, experiments.  
These aren’t portfolios. They’re living ideas — raw, practical, often weird.  
Clone ‘em. Use ‘em. Break ‘em.

> _Open source chaos._

### 🛸 Get Lost, Get Inspired

Explore freely. This space is for learners, tinkerers, misfits — and the quietly obsessed.  
Welcome to the other side of the terminal. 🖤
